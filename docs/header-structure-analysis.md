# HTML Header Structure Analysis & Optimization

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Multiple H1 Elements**
- **Problem**: Multiple components use `<h1>` tags, creating multiple H1s on a single page
- **Impact**: Confuses search engines and screen readers about page hierarchy
- **SEO Impact**: Dilutes keyword focus and reduces ranking potential

### 2. **Inconsistent Nesting**
- **Problem**: Headers skip levels (h1 → h3) without proper h2 structure
- **Impact**: Breaks document outline for assistive technologies
- **Accessibility Impact**: Screen reader users can't navigate content logically

### 3. **Missing Keyword Optimization**
- **Problem**: Headers use generic terms instead of crypto tax keywords
- **Impact**: Lost opportunities for search engine optimization
- **SEO Impact**: Reduced visibility for relevant search terms

### 4. **Semantic Structure Issues**
- **Problem**: Headers don't reflect actual content hierarchy
- **Impact**: Poor document structure for both users and crawlers
